#Run the powershell files in order

# FIRST AND FOREMOST: Update the Bluetooth package.appmanifest
# with the new version number!

# SECONDLY: be sure that the original docx file is checked in!
# just in case this process goes sideways, we should have a 
# nice backup

# Get the .docx etc. files into this directory
#   - also expands the .docx file into a temp directory
#     called mydoc
.\get-files.ps1

# Makes the image file for the cover
#     AND copies it into the expanded docx file director
#     AND rebuilds the docx file
# NOTE: this assumes that the front cover is "image2.png" in
#     the word file. That isn't always the case!
.\make-cover.ps1


# Manually copy the .docx file back to the original directory

.\clean-up.ps1
